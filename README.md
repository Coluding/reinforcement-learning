## Reinforcement Learning Code Examples for practice

### Summary
My goal here is to collect all the code I wrote to practice in my journey in learning Reinforcement Learning (RL). 
There are also several files which were offered by courses I took to practice the theoretical part of RL.

### Structure
#### Basic
The "basic" directory covers the fundamentals of RL like Bellman Equation, Monte Carlo Methods or Temporal Difference Learning in Gridworld.
It is the foundation to apply advanced methods in the other directories.
